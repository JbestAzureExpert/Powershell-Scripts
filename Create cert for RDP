Here is a procedure for generating certificates for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on a Windows Server:

Install the Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) role on the Windows Server.

Open the AD CS Configuration Wizard and select "Enterprise CA" as the CA type.

Choose a CA name and specify the CA's key characteristics, such as the key algorithm, key length, and validity period.

Select the database and log locations for the CA.

Configure the certificate revocation options, such as the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution point and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder.

Review the summary and complete the installation.

To generate a certificate for RDP:

Open the Certificate Templates console and create a new certificate template for RDP.

Configure the certificate template with the desired properties, such as the validity period, key usage, and subject name.

Publish the certificate template to the CA.

Request the certificate using the certificate template from either the CA's web enrollment page or from a client computer.

Install the certificate on the Remote Desktop Server.

Configure the Remote Desktop Server to use the certificate for RDP connections.
